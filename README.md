# Interactive Supplement

To open the interactive HTML version of the article:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory .
# then visit http://localhost:8000/index.html
```

To view locally using a simple local server, you need Python 3 installed.
Alternatively, open index.html directly in a browser, but some interactive elements may
not work without a server.
